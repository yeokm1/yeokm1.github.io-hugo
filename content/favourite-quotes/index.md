Repression, Sir is a habit that grows. I am told it is like making love-it is always easier the second time! The first time there may be pangs of conscience, a sense of guilt. But once embarked on this course with constant repetition you get more and more brazen in the attack. All you have to do is to dissolve organizations and societies and banish and detain the key political workers in these societies. Then miraculously everything is tranquil on the surface. Then an intimidated press and the government-controlled radio together can regularly sing your praises, and slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the evil things that have already been done, or if these things are referred to again they're conveniently distorted and distorted with impunity, because there will be no opposition to contradict.
-Lee Kuan Yew speaking to David Marshall, Singapore Legislative Assembly, Debates, 4 October, 1956 [Src][10]   (Amazing how this played out since 1956)

*To rely on technology when you think its going to provide an advantage when it doesn't, is actually a disadvantage.*

*If we all reacted the same way, we'd be predictable, and there's always more than one way to view a situation. What's true for the group is also true for the individual. It's simple: overspecialize, and you breed in weakness. It's slow death.*  
-Major Motoko Kusanagi telling Togusa (a normal human) why was he selected to be in a military unit full of cyborgs. Read: Diversity. Ghost In the Shell 1995 film [Src][25]

*We are the most powerful military force in the history of man. Every fight is our fight, because what happens over here matters over there. We don't get to sit one out. Learning to use the tools of modern warfare is the difference between the prospering of your people, and utter destruction. We can't give you freedom. But we can give you the know-how to acquire it. And that, my friends, is worth more than a whole army base of steel. Sure it matters who's got the biggest stick, but it matters a helluva lot more who's swinging it. This is a time for heroes. A time for legends. History is written by the victors. Let's get to work.*  
-Lieutenant General Shepherd in Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Second Mission briefing.  **Watch this [video][26] to feel the atmosphere of this words**.  [Src][27]

*Democracy? Democracy. Democracy is not what these people need, hell, it's not even what they want. America has been trying to install democracies in nations for a century and it hasn't worked one time. These countries don't have the most basic building blocks to support a democracy. Little things like, we ought to be tolerant of those that disagree with us. We ought to be tolerant of those who worship a different god than us! That, a journalist ought to be able to disagree with the president! And you think you can just march into these countries based on some fundamentalist, religious principles, drop a few bombs, topple a dictator and start a democracy? Huh. Give me a break. People don't want freedom. They want boundaries and rules… Protection… From invaders, and from themselves. People need a leader who can give them both the support and constraints to keep chaos at bay. You give them that, and they'll follow. And that's where I come in. Unlike the government we don't keep secrets of our capabilities. We don't sell policy, we sell power. We are a super power for hire!*  
-Jonathan Irons from Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. First quote from [official trailer][28] (Highly recommended).

*For a combat soldier, the difference between success and failure is your ability to adapt to your enemy. The people that I deal with, they don’t care about your rules. All they care about is results. My job is to stop them from accomplishing their objectives. I simply adapted. In answer to your question, am I above the law? No, sir. I am more than willing to be judged by the people you claim to represent. I will let them decide what price I should pay. But please, do not sit there with that smug look on your face and expect me to regret the decisions I have made. Because sir, the truth is … I don’t*  
-Jack Bauer defending himself in a Senate hearing against torture in 24 Season 7, Ep 1. [Src][29]

# Mine:

Don't believe in fate or destiny, believe in yourself.

Perfection is like an asymptote, you can get closer and closer but never reach it.

Scientists and engineers generally have weaker communication skills. I don't deny it. I say it's because we focus alot on getting our job done and move on rather than crapping through our words and presentations.

The shorter the question, the harder it is.

You have not truly read a book till you write a review on it.
